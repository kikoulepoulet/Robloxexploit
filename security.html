            <h2>How Roblox Fights Back Against Exploits</h2>
            <p>Over the years, Roblox has implemented several security measures to prevent and combat exploits, safeguarding the integrity of the platform for players and developers alike.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>1. Anti-Cheat Systems</h3>
            <p>Roblox continuously improves its <strong>anti-cheat systems</strong> to detect and block common exploits. These systems monitor player behavior, scan for modified clients, and automatically ban or kick users caught exploiting.</p>
            <p>Some popular exploits that Roblox targets include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speed hacks</li>
                <li>Teleport hacks</li>
                <li>In-game currency manipulation</li>
                <li>Unauthorized script execution</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>2. Token Systems</h3>
            <p>To prevent bypassing Roblox’s client-server communication, Roblox introduced <strong>token-based authentication</strong> systems. These tokens verify requests made by the client to ensure they are legitimate.</p>
            <p>How it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every action or transaction in-game requires a token from the server.</li>
                <li>The server validates the token, making sure it matches the request.</li>
                <li>If the token is invalid or tampered with, the request is denied, preventing exploitation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>3. Server-Side Validation</h3>
            <p><strong>Server-side validation</strong> has become one of Roblox's most effective methods to prevent exploits. Instead of relying on client-side data, which can be manipulated by exploiters, Roblox now validates crucial information on its servers.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Player positions are verified by the server to prevent teleportation hacks.</li>
                <li>In-game transactions, such as currency or inventory updates, are checked server-side to avoid duplication glitches or cheats.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>4. Patching Vulnerabilities</h3>
            <p>Roblox’s developers constantly monitor for new exploits and vulnerabilities. Once an exploit is identified, they release patches through game updates to close the security loophole.</p>
            <p>Notable examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Memory manipulation exploits patched by modifying how Roblox handles memory storage.</li>
                <li>Script injection exploits addressed by improving Lua execution security.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>5. Player Reports & Moderation</h3>
            <p>The Roblox community plays an important role in combating exploits. Players can report suspicious behavior, and moderators can investigate and take action. Roblox's moderation team is dedicated to keeping the platform fair and safe for all users.</p>
            <p>Players caught using exploits often face account bans, ranging from temporary suspensions to permanent deletions, depending on the severity of the offense.</p>
